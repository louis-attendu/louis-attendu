## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Louis Attendu. I'm a Belgian / Canadian living in Vienna.
I started my carreer as a mechanical engineer and swiftly migrated to process automation.

I've been working in large scale Digital Transformations and have had the chance to work for clients worldwide. My experience has led me through most phases of digitalizations: from as-is process and system analysis, requirements definition, Solution Architecture, Custom Application development/testing to solution implmentation and organizational change management.

When not at my computer, you'll usually find me at the climbing gym or in my woodworkshop!

I'm always on the lookout for new challenging projects.
If you have an idea please feel free to reach out!

Cheers!
